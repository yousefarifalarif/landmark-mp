# About Rent A Landmark

'Rent A Landmark' is a platform that lets you rent your favorite landmarks around the world on a daily basis.
If you own a landmark you can also rent it to others if you want. 

As a team of 4 students ([Katie](https://github.com/katiekk), [Ethan](https://github.com/EthanHardwick), [Yousef](https://github.com/yousefarifalarif), [Max](https://github.com/MaxKern)), we have designed, implemented, and shipped this Airbnb clone within 5 days during our time at the Le Wagon Web Development Bootcamp in London.

## Usage

Entering the homepage, you can browse all landmarks that are hosted on 'Rent A Landmark', search for landmarks in a specific city and have a detailed look at the description of the landmark.
Having signed up, you can then book a landmark for your desired time and pay via the platform.
Being the owner of a landmark, you can also start renting your landmark to others via 'Rent A Landmark' and thereby make some money. ;)
